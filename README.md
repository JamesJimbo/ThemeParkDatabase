# ThemeParkDatabase
A database powered by Queue-Times API that contains information about theme parks, including their name, country, company, continent, and coordinates. The user can choose to filter the data by some of these options. Another feature is that the user can choose a theme park and the GPS coordinates are shown to them via Google Maps.
